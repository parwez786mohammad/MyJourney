						<h3>✅ Project Overview:</h3><br>
						<p>Leading the transformation of asset and inventory tracking systems by migrating them to a scalable, web-based platform. The current system relies on offline Windows mobile applications and thick-client software, which limits flexibility and modernization. The goal is to enhance features and functionalities in line with current technological trends while designing a future-proof system that requires minimal changes for at least 10-15 years. Most modifications should be configurable, reducing dependency on code-level updates.</p>

						<h4>✅ Current Progress & Roadmap:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Asset Tracking Migration: In progress (2025 target)</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Migration to the new web-based platform is in progress.</li>
									<li>The rollout will begin with the Ministry of Finance, followed by phased deployment across all existing customers.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Inventory Tracking Migration: Scheduled for 2026</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>The goal is to integrate inventory tracking within the asset management system under a unified platform.</li>
									<li>The new system will enable both asset and inventory tracking to operate seamlessly within the same runtime environment, ensuring better integration and ease of use.</li>
									<li>A consistent front-end experience will be maintained across both modules for an intuitive user experience.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>✅ Key Responsibilities:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Solution Architecture & System Design:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Designing a highly scalable and future-proof system that can sustain at least 10-15 years without requiring major modifications to core features.</li>
									<li>Ensuring that most changes and enhancements can be configured dynamically rather than through code modifications.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Technical Leadership & Collaboration:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Working closely with senior management and technical teams to align development with business objectives.</li>
									<li>Leading implementation and testing teams, providing guidance on Feature-Based Requirements (FBR) documentation and test case creation.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Data Accuracy & Security:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Ensuring seamless data migration with high accuracy.</li>
									<li>Implementing robust security measures to protect sensitive asset and inventory data.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>✅ Expected Impact:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Enhanced Real-Time Tracking:</strong> Improved monitoring and control over assets and inventory.</li>
							<li><strong>40% Reduction in Manual Effort:</strong> Automation of key processes to improve operational efficiency.</li>
							<li><strong>Seamless System Integration:</strong> Unified asset and inventory tracking for a streamlined user experience.</li>
							<li><strong>Future-Proof Scalability:</strong> A long-term, adaptable system designed to evolve with minimal disruptions.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>This transformation will revolutionize asset and inventory management by leveraging modern web-based technologies, ensuring long-term sustainability, and significantly improving operational efficiency.</p>
